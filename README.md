## Netlify settings

Keep these settings:

```text
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Functions directory: netlify/functions
```

`netlify.toml` already maps `/api/news` to `/.netlify/functions/news`.

## Supabase setup

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. In Authentication > Providers, enable Google.
3. Add the deployed site URL to Authentication > URL Configuration.
4. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.
5. Add these Netlify environment variables:

```text
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Monetization notes

- Add AdSense publisher scripts only after approval.
- Keep paid placements labeled and separate from editorial RSS stories.
- Use `public/privacy.html`, `public/terms.html`, and `public/affiliate-disclosure.html` for review readiness.
- Store approved partner links in `public.affiliate_links` and keep `enabled=false` until reviewed.

## Deploy

Push to GitHub, then deploy from Netlify with the settings above. For CLI deploy:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --functions=netlify/functions
```
